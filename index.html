            <h2>The Power of Subonscious Mind</h2>
            <p> The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind is a spiritual self-help classic, 
            which teaches you how to use visualization and other suggestion techniques to adapt your unconscious behavior in positive way.
            The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind is one of few exceptions, likely because of two factors.First, the author, Joseph Murphy, 
            was a popular minister of the Church of Divine Science and second, because his book took root in both science and religion.</p>
